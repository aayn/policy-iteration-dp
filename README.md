# Policy Iteration: Dynamic Programming

Based on Example 4.2: Jack's Car Rental from chapter 4 of the textbook,
Reinforcement Learning: An Introduction by Richard S. Sutton and Andrew G. Barto
(2nd edition). This repo contains the example, policy iteration algorithm, and
exercise 4.7-related code.

Note that I have forced usage of some itertools recipies and higher-order
functions because I wanted to practice using them.

The code has been tested with Python 3, though it could also work with Python 2
with some minor tweaks.
